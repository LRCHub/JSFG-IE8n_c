Come on, it's gon be f hard
Special edition
and your AI couldn't copy
I'm leaving clues
in the fitting room
and it's hot tea
No I'm not thinking 'bout
no exes know they miss me
I got the whole room
spinning like it's tipsy
Don't bore us
take you to the chorus
Whooooooo wanna rock with Jennie
Keep your hair done,
nails done like Jennie
Who else got 'em obsessed
like Jennie
Like like like
Jennie Jennie Jennie
I think I really like
Haters they don't really like
Cause they can never ever be
But have you ever met
Jennie Jennie Jennie Jennie
Jennie
It's Jennie Jennie Jennie
Jennie Jennie
But have you ever met
But have you ever met
얼말 줘도 못해 서커스짓
포징 한 번에 만들어 mosh pit
They can't deal with me
cause I'm priceless
여러 셀럽들 속에 내 DNA
Get get outta my way
바비가 처키가 되기 전에
Name, shame, blame
Tryna burst my bubble
터트려봐 그럼 더 큰 홀에서
만나는 거야 제니를
Keep shading
예술작품엔 필요해 frame이
I've slayed it, and I graved it
Yes I'm guilty 잘난 게 죄니
Whooooooo wanna rock with Jennie
Keep you hair done,
nails done like Jennie
Who else got 'em obsessed
like Jennie
Like like like
I think I really like Jennie
Haters they don't really
like Jennie
Cause they can never ever be
Jennie
But have you ever met
Jennie Jennie Jennie
Jennie Jennie Jennie Jennie
It's Jennie Jennie Jennie
Jennie Jennie Jennie
Jennie
Like Jennie Jennie Jennie
Jennie Jennie
Rock with Jennie
Keep your hair done,
nails done like Jennie
Who else got 'em obsessed like
But have you ever met Jennie
But have you ever met
Jennie Jennie Jennie
It's Jennie Jennie Jennie Jennie
